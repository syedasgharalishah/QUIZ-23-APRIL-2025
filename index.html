If the clock shows 10 AM, the true time would be earlier. Assuming a common quiz pattern where if the clock shows 10 AM after 25 hours, the true time is 9 AM, indicating a net loss of 1 hour, which contradicts the gain. If the question meant 'what time will it show 24 hours later if it gains 5 minutes an hour, when it was set at 9 AM and the true time is 9 AM next day', it would be 9:05 AM. Given the options, there might be an error in the question or its intended answer from the source. I'll provide an answer based on a very common problem pattern where if a faulty clock shows a certain time, what is the correct time after 'X' hours when it has gained/lost. If it shows 10 AM next day (25 hours later), and gains 5 mins/hr, total gain is 125 minutes. So 10 AM - 125 minutes = 7:55 AM.
